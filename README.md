# Fall 2019 Foundations of Web Design and Development — Assignment 5 (More Design and Using Sass)

* **Do not edit this file.**  
* **Do not start this project until you have read these instructions carefully.**

## Instructions
Your task is to create a web site of Dieter Rams’s ten principles for good design. All ten are included in the accompanying file `ten-principles-for-good-design.txt`. You can create a single page site containing all ten rules, or a single site consisting of ten pages.

Your project must consist of the contents in the file `ten-principles-for-good-design.txt` and a navigation system, at the very least. Including open source images is encouraged.

## Before You Begin
1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Fork this repo(sitory). See [this video](http://code-warrior.github.io/tutorials/git/github/forking-and-cloning-at-the-github-web-site/) on how to carry out this step and step `3`.
3. Clone your fork, using either the web site or the GitHub Desktop client.
4. Checkout your personalized branch, the one with your name and GitHub user handle.

## Project Scaffold
This repo contains a folder called `site`, which, in turn, contains some starter files for this project. (See the **File List** section below.) Before you start, replace `PUT YOUR NAME HERE` in the `title` element of `index.html` with your name, and replace `PUT YOUR GIHUB USERNAME HERE` with your GitHub username.

### File List
1. `README.md`
2. `ten-principles-for-good-design.txt`
3. `site/css/reset.css`
4. `site/sass/style.scss`
5. `site/sass/.sass-lint.yml`
6. `site/index.html`
7. `site/img/`

**Note**: There are `.gitignore` files all across this scaffold. **Do not modify them.**
## The Rules
* You may not author any CSS, only Sass.
* Your Sass must be free from errors based on the rules in `site/.sass-lint.yml`.
* Only submit files that are required by your project: Do not submit working files, such as `.psd`, `.ai`, `.indd`, or `.sketch` files.
* Use lowercase, combined with kebab case, to name folders and files (`do-this` or `do-this.html`); no spaces in folder or file names (`not this`); no camel case (`notThis`); no snake case (`not_this`).
* Do not alter `reset.css`.
* Do not alter any of the `.gitignore` files.
* All your HTML files must go in the root of the `site` folder, with the `index.html` file acting as the springboard for your project.
* All your Sass files must be placed in the included `sass` folder.
* All the CSS your Sass generates must be placed in a file called `style.css`, which must be placed in the included `css` folder.
* Any images you might use must be placed in the `img` folder and must be 1MB or smaller.
* Your site’s design and UI must be logical, clear, and easy to use.
* You must use at most two typefaces. Look to [`https://fonts.google.com/`](https://fonts.google.com/) for ideas.
* You must use at most two colors, in addition to a neutral. Look to [`https://color.adobe.com/`](https://color.adobe.com/) for ideas.

## Validate
Make sure Atom continually reports `No errors were found!` in the lower left hand corner and that your Sass is validating according to the rules in `.sass-lint.yml`. Solve validation issues and Sass rules violations as you work — don’t let them accumulate.

## Due
Wednesday, 4 December 2019, at 11:30 AM.

## Submission
You will need to issue a pull request back into the original repo, the one from which your fork was created. See the **Issuing Pull Requests** section of [this site](http://code-warrior.github.io/tutorials/git/github/index.html) for help on how to submit your assignment.

**Note**: This assignment may *only* be submitted via GitHub. **No other form of submission will be accepted**.
